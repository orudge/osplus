OSPlus Text Editor - Open Source Version
Version 2.1.1

Copyright (c) Owen Rudge 2000-2005
==================================

Thanks for downloading the Win32 version of OSPlus Text Editor 2.1.1! This
has evolved a fair bit since it was closed source, and now includes features such
as sound support and file format conversion.

This version of OSPlus Text Editor includes support for playing sounds (WAV
and MIDI). An MP3 or Ogg Vorbis player may be added to this in future.

This version also has the capability of using Microsoft text converters (supplied
with Microsoft Office, etc) to convert a variety of text formats, including
Microsoft Word format, into plain text. The Win32 version does this by default,
reading a list of converters from the Windows Registry. At the moment, it is not
possible to disable the use of Win32 converters on the Windows version without
editing the source code. The next version will have a configuration option to
disable or alter the behaviour of this.
