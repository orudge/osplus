BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ (WIN64)
=============================================================

To build the 64-bit (AMD64) MSVC version of the Text Editor, you need:

- Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 (2005) or higher. I have tested it with 9.0 (2007) and
  10.0 (2010).

- The latest Turbo Vision CVS checkout, available from
  http://tvision.sourceforge.net/. Stable versions may compile with the 64-bit
  compiler, but I have not tested them.

  Note that when I built Turbo Vision for 64-bit, I had to remove
  -D_USE_32BIT_TIME_T from makes/config.nmk. Otherwise, everything appeared
  to build and function normally.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  http://www.eunet.bg/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, if you wish to modify
  dialogs. Note that the .dlg files are actually quite outdated now, and you
  of course can't run Dialog Designer natively on 64-bit versions of Windows.

TO BUILD
========

You must build Turbo Vision and copy the include files to <VCDIR>\Include and
<VCDIR>\Include\tv as appropriate, and librhtv.lib to <VCDIR>\Lib\AMD64.

Then open up a command prompt with the x64 build tools in your path, and
simply type the following to build this version:

   nmake /f w32msvc.mak

The object files will be placed in obj/w32msvc, and the binaries will be placed
in bin/w32msvc.

If you have the UPX executable compressor installed (see http://upx.sf.net/), you can
then compress the executables, reducing their sizes significantly, by running:

   nmake /f w32msvc.mak compress
