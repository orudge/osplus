BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH BORLAND C++ (WIN32)
====================================================

To build the Win32 version of the Text Editor, you need:

- Borland C++Builder 4.0 or higher (may work with 3.0) - you need BCC32
  to be version 5.4 or higher (may work with earlier versions). The free
  command line tools should work.

- Turbo Vision 1.1.3 or better, available from http://tvision.sourceforge.net/.
  Turbo Vision 2.0.3 is recommended.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  http://www.eunet.bg/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, if you wish to modify
  dialogs. Note that the .dlg files are actually quite outdated now, so you may
  be better off simply modifying the source files.

TO BUILD
========

You must build Turbo Vision and copy the include files to <CBDIR>\Include and
<CBDIR>\Include\tv as appropriate, and RHTV.LIB to <CBDIR>\LIB. Please note you may
also need to create a directory called <CBDIR>\Include\tvision and place a copy of tv.h
in it. This is because I was lazy and couldn't be bothered to go through all the code
and set another different path for a compiler... ;-) [Actually, I can't remember if this
is still the case, as of 1st Jan 2005... try it and see]

Then simply type the following to build this version:

   make /f win32.mak

The object files will be placed in obj/win32, and the binaries will be placed in bin/win32.

If you have the UPX executable compressor installed (see http://upx.sf.net/), you can
then compress the executables, reducing their sizes significantly, by running:

   make /f win32.mak compress
