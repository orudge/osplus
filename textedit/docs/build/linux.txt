BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR FOR LINUX
=====================================

To build the Linux version of the Text Editor, you need:

- The GNU C Compiler, gcc. OSPlus Text Editor has been known to work with gcc 3.2+. Earlier versions
  have not been tested recently.

- Turbo Vision 1.1.3 or better, available from http://tvision.sourceforge.net/. Turbo Vision 2.0.3
  is recommended.

- A DOS emulator such as dosemu or a DOS machine to run Dialog Designer if you wish.

To make use of Win32 file converters, you will also require:

- Wine, available from http://www.winehq.org/. OSPlus Text Editor has been tested with wine 20041201,
  but any reasonably recent version should work.

TO BUILD
========

To build this version, simply run:

   ./configure linux

If you have Wine installed and want Win32 converter support, append `--with-wine'.

You can then simply run:

   make

to build OSPlus Text Editor. The object files will be placed in obj/linux, and the binaries will be
placed in bin/linux.

If you have the UPX executable compressor installed (see http://upx.sf.net/), you can
then compress the executables, reducing their sizes significantly, by running:

   make compress
