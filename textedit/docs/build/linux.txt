BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR FOR LINUX
=====================================

To build the Linux version of the Text Editor, you need:

- The GNU C Compiler, gcc. OSPlus Text Editor has been known to work with gcc 3.2+. Earlier versions
  have not been tested recently.

- Turbo Vision 1.1.3 or better, available from http://tvision.sourceforge.net/. Turbo Vision 2.0.3
  is recommended.

- A DOS emulator such as dosemu or a DOS machine to run Dialog Designer if you wish.

For the version with sound support, you also need:

- Allegro 4.0. Available from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/. Earlier WIPs should work,
  but 3.12 will not (as it is DOS only anyway).

To make use of Win32 file converters, you will also require:

- WINE, available from http://www.winehq.com/. OSPlus Text Editor has been tested with wine 20041201,
  but any reasonably recent version should work.

TO BUILD
========

To build this version, simply run:

   ./configure linux

For a version with sound support, append `--with-alleg', and if you have WINE installed, append
`--with-wine'.

You can then simply run:

   make

to build OSPlus Text Editor. The object files for the version with sound will be placed in
obj/linuxsnd, and the binaries will be placed in bin/linuxsnd. The version without sound will
store files in obj/linux and bin/linux respectively.

If you have the UPX executable compressor installed (see http://upx.sf.net/), you can
then compress the executables, reducing their sizes significantly, by running:

   make compress
