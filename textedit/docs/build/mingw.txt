BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH MINGW
======================================

To build the DJGPP version of the Text Editor, you need:

- MinGW32 2.0 or higher, 3.x recommended

- The Cygwin make utility may also be required - see www.cygwin.com

- Turbo Vision, available from http://tvision.sourceforge.net/. Turbo Vision 2.0.3
  is recommended.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  http://www.eunet.bg/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, if you wish to modify
  dialogs. Note that the .dlg files are actually quite outdated now, so you may
  be better off simply modifying the source files.

TO BUILD
========

If you do not have the Cygwin make tool (the MinGW32 tool doesn't seem to work properly
for this), you must open the Makefile, look for the "#### MINGW/CYGWIN ####" section
and change the:

   RHTV_CFLAGS   = `rhtv-config --cflags`
   RHTV_CPPFLAGS = `rhtv-config --cppflags`
   RHTV_INCLUDE  = `rhtv-config --include`
   RHTV_DIR_LIBS = `rhtv-config --dir-libs`
   RHTV_SLIBS    = `rhtv-config --slibs`

lines so they have the output of the commands specified. For example:

   RHTV_CFLAGS   = -O2
   ...
   RHTV_INCLUDE  = -I/c/Various/tv203/contrib/tvision/include -Id:/mingw32/msys/include/rhtvision
   ...

(on my system).

You should then run the configure.bat file with the 'mingw' parameter. After that, you
can then simply run:

   make

to build OSPlus Text Editor. Object files will be placed in obj/mingw32, and binaries in
bin/mingw32.

If you have the UPX executable compressor installed (see http://upx.sf.net/), you can
then compress the executables, reducing their sizes significantly, by running:

   make compress
