BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH DJGPP
======================================

To build the DJGPP version of the Text Editor, you need:

- DJGPP 2.03 or better

- Turbo Vision, available from http://tvision.sourceforge.net/. Turbo Vision 2.0.3
  is recommended.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  http://www.eunet.bg/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, if you wish to modify
  dialogs. Note that the .dlg files are actually quite outdated now, so you may
  be better off simply modifying the source files.

If you want sound support in your copy of the Text Editor, you also need:

- Allegro 4.0 or better, available from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/. The Text
  Editor may still build with Allegro 3.12, but this hasn't been tested
  recently, and 4.0 contains many important and useful updates anyway.

TO BUILD
========

To build this version, you must first edit the Makefile and change the
RHTV_INCLUDE, RHTV_DIR_LIBS and RHTV_SLIBS lines in the DJGPP section to
the appropriate values for your Turbo Vision installation. Typing:

   rhtv-config --include
   rhtv-config --dir-libs
   rhtv-config --slibs

should output the appropriate data to your screen.

You should then run the configure.bat file with the 'djgpp' parameter. If you have
the Allegro games library installed for sound support, add --with-alleg. For example:

   configure djgpp                  [without sound]
   configure djgpp --with-alleg     [with sound]

You can then simply run:

   make

to build OSPlus Text Editor. Object files will be placed in obj/djgpp (or obj/djgppsnd),
and binaries in bin/djgpp (or bin/djgppsnd).

If you have the UPX executable compressor installed (see http://upx.sf.net/), you can
then compress the executables, reducing their sizes significantly, by running:

   make compress
