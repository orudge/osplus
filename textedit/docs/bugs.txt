KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

- With the Borland C++ (Win32) port, a GPF is sometimes generated when you quit the editor if
  you've played a MIDI file

- If you use the Change Directory option, OSPlus Text Editor can no longer find the path to its
  converter files.

- Sometimes certain converters (especially the Win32 ones) don't always work, or produce an empty
  temporary file.
