OSPlus Text Editor - Open Source Version
Version 2.1.2

Copyright (c) Owen Rudge 2000-2009
==================================

Thanks for downloading the Win64 version of OSPlus Text Editor 2.1.2! This
has evolved a fair bit since it was closed source, and now includes features such
as sound support and file format conversion.

This version of OSPlus Text Editor includes support for playing sounds (WAV
and MIDI). An MP3 or Ogg Vorbis player may be added to this in future.

This version also has the capability of using Microsoft text converters (supplied
with Microsoft Office, etc) to convert a variety of text formats, including
Microsoft Word format, into plain text. A list of converters is read from the
Windows Registry. At the moment, it is not possible to disable the use of
Microsoft converters on the Windows version without editing the source code.
A future version will have a configuration option to disable or alter the
behaviour of this.

Note that 64-bit converters are required for use with the 64-bit version of
the Editor. Future versions of the Editor may be able to support 32-bit
converters.
