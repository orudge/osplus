Copyright (c) Owen Rudge 2000-2009
==================================

Thanks for downloading the Win64 version of OSPlus Text Editor 2.1.1! OSPlus
Text Editor is a friendly text editor for DOS, with a multi-window text user
interface, support for reading RTF and Windows Write files, and more.

This version has the capability of using Microsoft text converters (supplied
with Microsoft Office, etc) to convert a variety of text formats, including
Microsoft Word format, into plain text. The Win32 version does this by default,
reading a list of converters from the Windows Registry.

Note that 64-bit converters are required for use with the 64-bit version of
the Editor. Future versions of the Editor may be able to support 32-bit
converters.
