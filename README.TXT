OSPlus Open Source Readme
=========================

I have released OSPlus as Open Source. I am currently cleaning up the code
(making it slightly more readable, slightly less lazy, and so on). I have
released the code for the Disk Imager and Utility Kit version of the Text
Editor so far. You can download the full version of OSPlus and the Utility
Kit (binaries only) from www.osplus.co.uk.

I used Borland C++ 4.51 to build the sources, with Turbo Vision. You can
download Turbo Vision (TV) from Borland's site, see below for the location.
It has also been ported to DJGPP by the Open Source community, and you can
download that at www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/6552/ I think. I
have ported the Text Editor to DJGPP. You need Turbo Vision from the above
address for this. It would probably be possible to port the Disk Imager
with a bit of work.

I used a free program called DLGDSN (Dialog Designer) to design a couple
of dialogs in Disk Imager, you can download that at
http://www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html.
