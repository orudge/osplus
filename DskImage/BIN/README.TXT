**************************************

The OSPlus Disk Imager is a utility that lets you read floppy disks and
create images of them on your hard disk. These can then be written to a CD,
e-mailed or uploaded to the Internet. The Disk Imager also lets you write
these images back to a floppy disk. Be warned that any existing data will
be DESTROYED.

The image you write doesn't have to have been created with the Disk Imager.
There are no identifing "marks" in the image file that say it's been created
with the Disk Imager - it's just the exact contents of the floppy disk. This
can be written back to disk with other tools such as RAWRITE (which Disk
Imager is based on).

You can download the source code to the Disk Imager at the following places:

Open Source web site:  http://osplus.sourceforge.net/
SourceForge account:   http://sourceforge.net/projects/osplus/
Main OSPlus web site:  http://www.osplus.co.uk/

Enjoy!
