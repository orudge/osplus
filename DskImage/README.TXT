OSPLUS DISK IMAGER SOURCE CODE NOTES
====================================

This code requires Borland C++ to compile. I believe it will work
with Borland C++ 3.0 or higher, but I have compiled and tested it with
Borland C++ 4.51. Any version of BC above 4.0 should work. See the
/README.TXT for information on where to obtain Turbo Vision.

I have used the code in RAWRITE by Mark Becker. Thanks to him for
creating the code. I have also incorporated disk reading into Disk
Imager, using the code from RAWREAD, by Hans Lermen.

It is recommended you use the Borland C++ IDE for development, but a
MAKEFILE has been provided anyway. You must modify BCPATH= in the
makefile.

Happy hacking!
