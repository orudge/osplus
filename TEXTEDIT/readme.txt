OSPlus Text Editor - Open Source Version
Version 2.1.1

Copyright (c) Owen Rudge 2000-2005
==================================

Thanks for downloading the source code to the OSPlus Text Editor! This has
evolved a fair bit since it was closed source, and now includes features such
as sound support and file format conversion.

There are a number of different builds for the Text Editor, which are:

- Borland C++ 4.x (real mode DOS)
- DJGPP (protected mode DOS)
- DJGPP with Allegro (protected mode DOS, sound support)
- Linux
- Linux with Allegro (sound support)
- Win32 (Borland C++ Builder, or free C++ tools)
- Win32 (Microsoft Visual C++)
- Win32 (MinGW32)

There has recently been some directory reorganisation and the new system is a
lot cleaner and more logical. You will find documentation on building the Text
Editor in the docs/build directory.

A NOTE ABOUT WIN32 CONVERTERS
=============================

The Win32 and Linux versions of OSPlus Text Editor have the capability of using
Microsoft text converters (supplied with Microsoft Office, etc) to convert a
variety of text formats, including Microsoft Word format, into plain text.
(In fact, the converts convert to RTF, and that output is then passed through
the OSPlus RTF converter). The Win32 version does this by default, reading a list
of converters from the Windows Registry. On Linux, WINE must be installed and
the --with-wine option must be passed to the configure script. Also, the converter
DLL pack must be downloaded and installed - see the OSPlus web site (www.osplus.co.uk)
for more information on that.

At the moment, it is not possible to disable the use of Win32 converters on the
Windows version without editing the source code. The next version will have a
configuration option to disable or alter the behaviour of this.
