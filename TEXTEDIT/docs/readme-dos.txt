OSPlus Text Editor - Open Source Version
Version 2.1.1

Copyright (c) Owen Rudge 2000-2005
==================================

Thanks for downloading the real-mode DOS version of OSPlus Text Editor 2.1.1! This
has evolved a fair bit since it was closed source, and now includes features such
as sound support and file format conversion.

This version of Text Editor includes support for playing sounds in the
background. You need to run one of the following programs to install the
driver:

BDSB.EXE      -  Sound Blaster
BDSBPRO.EXE   -  Sound Blaster Pro
BDSB16.EXE    -  Sound Blaster 16
BDCS4235.EXE  -  CS4235

If you choose the wrong one, the system could lock up if it installs itself
and you try to play a sound. The driver should display an error message if
it cannot initialise the sound card. You must also type the following
command before you start the Text Editor to enable sound:

SET OSPSOUND=TRUE

To disable sound, type "SET OSPSOUND=". The sound drivers are written by
Heinz Rath (www.geocities.com/heinz_rath/).
