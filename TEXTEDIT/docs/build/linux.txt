BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR FOR LINUX
=====================================

To build the Linux version of the Text Editor, you need:

- gcc (I don't know what version (2.95?), but a recent one should do fine), etc

- Turbo Vision 1.1.3 or better, available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/setedit/.

- A DOS emulator such as dosemu or a DOS machine to run Dialog Designer if
  you wish.

For the version with sound support, you also need:

- Allegro 4.0. Available from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/. Earlier WIPs should work,
  but 3.12 will not.

TO BUILD
========

You must edit `buildlnx' so that the Turbo Vision include path is correct. (Alternatively,
copy the header files to /usr/include in the appropriate directories). Building is a
simple case of typing `buildlnx'.

The object files for the version with sound will be placed in obj/linuxsnd, and the binaries
will be placed in bin/linuxsnd. The version without sound will store files in obj/linux and
bin/linux respectively.

Please note that I haven't built the Linux version in a while. It may not compile. Please let
me know how you get on. E-mail me at webmaster@osplus.co.uk.
