BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR FOR LINUX
=====================================

To build the Linux version of the Text Editor, you need:

- gcc (I don't know what versions will not work, but a recent one should do fine - OSPlus Text
  Editor has been known to compile fine with gcc 2.96 and similar versions), and standard build
  tools

- Turbo Vision 1.1.3 or better, available from http://tvision.sourceforge.net/. Turbo Vision 2.0
  is recommended.

- A DOS emulator such as dosemu or a DOS machine to run Dialog Designer if you wish.

For the version with sound support, you also need:

- Allegro 4.0. Available from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/. Earlier WIPs should work,
  but 3.12 will not (as it is DOS only anyway).

TO BUILD
========

You must edit `buildlnx' so that the Turbo Vision include path is correct. (Alternatively,
copy the header files to /usr/include in the appropriate directories - the TV 2.0 make install
copies the headers to /usr/include/rhtvision). Building is a simple case of typing `buildlnx'.

The object files for the version with sound will be placed in obj/linuxsnd, and the binaries
will be placed in bin/linuxsnd. The version without sound will store files in obj/linux and
bin/linux respectively.
