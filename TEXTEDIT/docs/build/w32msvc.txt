BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ (WIN32)
=============================================================

To build the MSVC version of the Text Editor, you need:

- Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 or higher (may work with 4.x). I have tested it with
  versions 6.0, 7.0 (MSVC.NET) and 7.1 (MSVC.NET 2003) though,
  so it may not work on 4.x/5.x. I have also tested 8.0 (2005), but could not get
  Turbo Vision to compile.

- Turbo Vision 1.1.3 or better, available from http://tvision.sourceforge.net/.
  Turbo Vision 2.0.3 is recommended.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, to modify some dialogs

TO BUILD
========

You must build Turbo Vision and copy the include files to <VCDIR>\Include and
<VCDIR>\Include\tv as appropriate, and LIBTV.LIB to <VCDIR>\LIB.

Then simply type the following to build this version:

   nmake /f w32msvc.mak

The object files will be placed in obj/w32msvc, and the binaries will be placed
in bin/w32msvc.

If you have the UPX executable compressor installed (see http://upx.sf.net/), you can
then compress the executables, reducing their sizes significantly, by running:

   nmake /f w32msvc.mak compress
