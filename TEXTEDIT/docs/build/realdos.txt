BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH BORLAND C++ (REAL-MODE DOS)
============================================================

The real-mode DOS version of the Text Editor requires:

- Borland C++ 4.0 or higher (may work with 3.x - untested)

- Borland PowerPack for DOS. Alternatively, download Turbo Vision from
  Borland's web site at www.borland.com.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, to modify the About dialogs

- Heinz Rath's sound drivers available from www.geocities.com/heinz_rath/ if
  you want to be able to play WAV files from the Text Editor. These are not
  required for building.

TO BUILD
========

To build this version, you must first edit REALDOS.MAK and change the
BCC_INC and BCC_LIB lines to point to your Borland C++ installation.
Then, ensuring the appropriate tools are in your PATH, simply type:

   make /f realdos.mak

at the command prompt.

It is recommended that you use the IDE to build this version, as the executable
produced is much smaller. (The Generate Makefile command must have missed some
switches or something). The project file is called OSPEDIT.IDE.

The generated object files will be placed in OBJ\REALDOS, and the binaries will
be placed in BIN\REALDOS.

If you have the UPX executable compressor installed (see http://upx.sf.net/), you can
then compress the executables, reducing their sizes significantly, by running:

   upx --best --8086 bin/realdos/ospedit.exe bin/realdos/txtrtf.cnv bin/realdos/txtwrite.cnv

(the --8086 flag is only necessary if you plan on running OSPlus Text Editor on an 8086
or similar machine)
