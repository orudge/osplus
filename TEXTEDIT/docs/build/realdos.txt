BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH BORLAND C++ (REAL-MODE DOS)
============================================================

The real-mode DOS version of the Text Editor requires:

- Borland C++ 4.0 or higher (may work with 3.x - untested)

- Borland PowerPack for DOS. Alternatively, download Turbo Vision from
  Borland's web site at www.borland.com.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, to modify the About dialogs

- Heinz Rath's sound drivers available from www.geocities.com/heinz_rath/ if
  you want to be able to play WAV files from the Text Editor. These are not
  required for building.

TO BUILD
========

To build this version, you must first edit REALDOS.MAK and change the
"BCPATH=C:\BC45" line to the appropriate value for your machine. Then type:

   SET BCPATH=d:\bc_directory\BIN\MAKE.EXE
   BUILDBC

at the command prompt, where "d:\bc_directory" is the path to your Borland
C++ directory.

It is recommended that you use the IDE to build this version, as the executable
produced is much smaller. (The Generate Makefile command must have missed some
switches or something). The project file is called OSPEDIT.IDE.

The generated object files will be placed in OBJ\REALDOS, and the binaries will
be placed in BIN\REALDOS.
