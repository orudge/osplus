BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH DJGPP WITH SOUND
=================================================

To build the DJGPP version of the Text Editor with sound support, you need:

- DJGPP 2.03 or better

- Turbo Vision, available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/setedit/

- Allegro 4.0 or better, available from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/. The Text
  Editor should still build with Allegro 3.12, but this hasn't been tested
  recently, and 4.0 contains many important and useful updates anyway.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, to modify the About dialogs

TO BUILD
========

To build this version, you must first edit djgpp.mak and change the
"DJDIR=C:\DJGPP" line to the appropriate value for your machine. Then type:

   SET DJPATH=d:\djgpp_dir\BIN\MAKE.EXE
   BUILDDJ

at the command prompt, where "d:\djgpp_dir" is the path to your DJGPP directory.
The object files will be placed in obj/djgppsnd, and the binaries will be placed
in bin/djgppsnd.

There is also a RHIDE project file available. To build using RHIDE, open
DJGPPSND.GPR. Please note that you need RHIDE 1.4.7.8 or higher to use this file.
