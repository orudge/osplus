BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH DJGPP - NO SOUND
=================================================

To build the DJGPP version of the Text Editor, you need:

- DJGPP 2.03 or better

- Turbo Vision, available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/setedit/

- Dialog Designer, available from
  www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, to modify the About dialogs

TO BUILD
========

To build this version, you must first edit djgpp.mak and change the
"DJDIR=C:\DJGPP" line to the appropriate value for your machine. Then type:

   SET DJPATH=d:\djgpp_dir\BIN\MAKE.EXE
   BUILDDNA

at the command prompt, where "d:\djgpp_dir" is the path to your DJGPP directory.
The object files will be placed in obj/djgpp, and the binaries will be placed
in bin/djgpp.

There is also a RHIDE project file available. To build using RHIDE, open DJGPP.GPR.
Please note that you need RHIDE 1.4.7.8 or higher to use this file.
