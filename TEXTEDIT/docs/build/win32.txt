BUILDING OSPLUS TEXT EDITOR WITH BORLAND C++ (WIN32)
====================================================

To build the Win32 version of the Text Editor, you need:

- Borland C++Builder 4.0 or higher (may work with 3.0) - you need BCC32
  to be version 5.4 or higher (may work with earlier versions). The free
  command line tools should work.

- Turbo Vision 1.1.3 or better, available from http://tvision.sourceforge.net/.
  Turbo Vision 2.0 is recommended.

- Dialog Designer, available from
  www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/turbovis.html, to modify the About dialogs

TO BUILD
========

You must build Turbo Vision and copy the include files to <CBDIR>\Include and
<CBDIR>\Include\tv as appropriate, and RHTV.LIB to <CBDIR>\LIB. Please note you also
need to create a directory called <CBDIR>\Include\tvision and place a copy of tv.h
in it. This is because I was lazy and couldn't be bothered to go through all the code
and set another different path for a compiler... ;-)

Type the following to build this version:

   SET CBPATH=d:\cb_dir\BIN\MAKE.EXE
   BUILDWIN

where "d:\cb_dir" is the path to your C++Builder directory. The object files will be
placed in obj/win32, and the binaries will be placed in bin/win32.
