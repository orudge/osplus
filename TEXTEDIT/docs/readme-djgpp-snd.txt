==================================

Thanks for downloading the DJGPP version of OSPlus Text Editor 2.1.1! This
has evolved a fair bit since it was closed source, and now includes features such
as sound support and file format conversion.

This version of OSPlus Text Editor includes support for playing sounds (WAV

will automatically try to detect your sound card on startup.
